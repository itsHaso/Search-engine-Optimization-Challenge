## Description
For This project all i did was clean up the code made it follow a logical order removed some unnecessary css and just generally cleaned up the project. 

My motivation to work on this project was to further my understanding of HTML and CSS by cleaning up somebody else's work to get a better grasp.
I was able to figure out how to make my code more presentable for other developers to look at and potentially work on it further.
